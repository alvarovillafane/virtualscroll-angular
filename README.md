# Ideas

- Convertir casi todo to OnPush detection

## NGX virtual scroll

- Seems ok, a bit laggy with >50 columns
- Good candidate, easy to implement
- Support infinite scroll
- Only virtual scroll in one direction (vertically)
- Not so sure about support

## CDK virtual scroller

- Seems ok, better performance than virtual scroll
- Support for variable height is experimental
- If we go this route, we should have fixed height?
- Better support

## CDK table?

## Manual with intersection observer

## AG Grid

## Tan Stack core
